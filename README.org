* Google Code Jam Haskell Framework

Here I'll post some Google Code Jam solutions in Haskell (the language
I love to learn).  Some past solutions can also be found it my other
[[http://github.com/joranvar/GoogleCodeJam][Google Code Jam]] repository, but as of today I'm rewriting the
framework and the solutions using theories I came across while using
F# at work.  This work is mainly intended as practice for the oncoming
Jam ([[https://code.google.com/codejam][2016-04-08]]), and to improve my use of the Haskell language.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for *your* entries, but
remember, sharing the solution to any actual Google Code Jam problems
is only allowed /after/ each round is completed, at risk of
disqualification.  Also remember, this code is covered by the GPL,
version 3 or (at your option) any later version.
